 # Golang Https webapplication

this is a simple web application, a todo app I have been working on to help
understand the backend benefits of golang. This is all apart of my journey on learning the backend of web development well enough to turn it into a career. It has always been something I have been wanting to get into since I started working on development in the first place.

## How  to check it out?

To keep things simple I didnt run the mini app though any manjor framework, and if you wanna see it in person you will need 2 thing.

### 1. Go installed
### 2. how to open up a local port

if you have go installed all you need to do it go into the server dir and run "go run main.go".

in the terminal it will print out a few lines explaining the port it has gone to as well as how to open and close it down. This is to make it easier on people who may not use the terminal very often, and I figured it would be a bit helpful. 

## Status

this is not a complete app as some of the buttons dont work just yet, it was more a way for me to understand how the templates work with golang, I may end up using this to make a full web application, but I may end up using ReactJs to build a proper application with a Go backend.
